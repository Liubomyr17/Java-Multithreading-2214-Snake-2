Snake 2

Now the fun part. How the snake will be arranged.
What about the snake?
In fact, a snake is a set of pieces - cells. But it is known for sure that one of them is the head.
The snake has a direction of movement
So we still need classes:
SnakeSection - a snake slice
SnakeDirection - class enum will describe the direction of movement of the snake

Create a SnakeSection and SnakeDirection class.
